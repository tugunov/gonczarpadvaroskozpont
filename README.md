# Revision of public transport hub Göncz Árpád városközpont (Budapest, Hungary)

This project was focused on diagnosing and proposing actionable improvements to one of Budapest's most critical multimodal transport hubs — Göncz Árpád városközpont. The hub connects metro line M3, tram line 1, and urban/suburban bus networks, serving over 65,000 daily users.

#### Project Objectives:
- Enhance passenger accessibility and wayfinding
- Improve efficiency of public transport operations
- Minimize delays and pedestrian transfer times
- Prepare for the integration of a new tram line (Route 3 extension)

#### Methodology and Key Stages:
1. Field Data Collection (Oct–Dec 2024):
- Manual counts (80+ hours) of pedestrian flows (9 exits) and vehicle movements (16 traffic movements)
- Infrastructure measurements (e.g., stair/elevator dimensions, signal phases)
- Transit timetable analysis across metro, bus, and tram services
2. Microsimulation Modelling (Jan–Apr 2025):
- Built a 4-level multimodal model in PTV Vissim 2022, including underground pedestrian systems, vehicle traffic, and public transport
- Simulated 14 future scenarios covering tram operations, bus layovers, and pedestrian accessibility
- Generated origin-destination (OD) matrices from real-world data
3. Scenario Analysis & Results:
- Pedestrian transfer times reduced by 9–11% with new tram stops
- Tram delays increased by 35–85%, requiring timetable adjustments with a new tram route
- Right-turn vehicle delays reduced by 15–20% with a new bus layover facility
- Queue lengths optimized without causing traffic congestion in most cases

This project provides a data-driven foundation for future upgrades of the interchange and supports long-term multimodal transport planning in Budapest.

#### Recommendations for Implementation:
- Extend the Budapest tram route 3 with a new terminal at Göncz Árpád városközpont
- Build 4 new elevators and at-grade pedestrian crossings
- Introduce a modern navigation system for underground concourses
- Construct a new bus layover zone with driver amenities
